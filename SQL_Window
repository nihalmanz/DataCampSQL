Reigning champions by gender and event
In the previous exercise, you partitioned by gender to ensure that data about one gender doesn't get mixed into data about the other gender. If you have multiple columns, however, partitioning by only one of them will still mix the results of the other columns.

Return the previous champions of each year's events by gender and event.


SELECT
  Gender, Year, Event,
  Country AS Champion,
  -- Fetch the previous year's champion by gender and event
  lag(Country) OVER (partition by gender,Event
            ORDER BY Year ASC) AS Last_Champion
from summer_medals
WHERE Year>=2000 and Discipline = 'Athletics' AND
    Event IN ('100M', '10000M') AND
    Medal = 'Gold'
ORDER BY Event ASC, Gender ASC, Year ASC;
